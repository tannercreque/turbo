# Welcome to Turbo !

###Turbo is...
Turbo is a car enthusiast's version of tinder. You can like (turbo) or dislike (downshift) vehicles and cycle through our user's cars, as well as give them feedback on it. On the landing page you will be able to create your account or you can click the browse cars button if you do not want to create an account with us. In creating an account you can add an image of your own car to be seen by others.

### Landing page:
Upon loading into the very first page, you are given a form to put in your *name, your cars name, your cars make, model and year*, as well as a spot for you to add an image. If you do not want to fill out this information you can click the *browse cars* button which will take you directly to the place to give people feedback on their own vehicles.

### User experience:
After either completing the signup form or clicking the *browse cars* button, you are directed to a page with an image of another user's car, with two options of a turbo or downshift (turbo being a "like" or downshift being a "dislike"). When you turbo or downshift a user's car you are automatically redirected to the next user's car. Unlimited fun !
